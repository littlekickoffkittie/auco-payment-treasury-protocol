# AuCo: Peer-to-Commerce Payment & Treasury Protocol

## Project Overview
AuCo is a comprehensive protocol designed to enable businesses to accept cryptocurrency payments and effectively manage treasury operations by deploying funds into decentralized finance (DeFi) strategies. The aim is to create a user-friendly platform that minimizes operational complexity while maintaining the benefits of self-custody, empowering businesses to engage in the on-chain economy securely and efficiently.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (>=14.x)
- PostgreSQL database
- An Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) for interaction with the application

### Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/auco-protocol.git
   cd auco-protocol
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   - Copy the sample environment variables file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   - Update `.env` with your specific settings, including database credentials and any API keys needed.

4. **Database Setup**
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running.
   - Create a new database and run the migration scripts to initialize your schema (see the backend section).

5. **Start the Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

1. **Frontend Access**
   - Open the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
   - Connect your Ethereum wallet when prompted.
   - Utilize the dashboard to create invoices, manage treasury strategies, and visualize financial data.

2. **Backend API**
   - The backend API is accessible at `http://localhost:5000/api`.
   - Utilize the RESTful endpoints to interact programmatically, including managing invoices and treasury data.

## Features
- **Wallet Integration**: Connect with Ethereum wallets for seamless transactions.
- **Payment Gateway**: Accept a variety of cryptocurrencies with automatic swaps to stablecoins.
- **Treasury Management**: Manage and allocate funds into yield-generating strategies like Aave and Compound.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard**: Access real-time stats on treasury performance, transaction history, and strategy information.
- **Automated Security Protocols**: Enforced multi-signature approvals for treasury control and time-lock mechanisms for critical operations.

## Dependencies
The following key packages are utilized in the project (from `package.json`):
- `Node.js` for the backend and scripts.
- `Express.js` for API development.
- `PostgreSQL` as the database.
- `Next.js` for the frontend framework.
- `Ethers.js` and `Wagmi` for blockchain interactions.
- Various libraries for testing and monitoring.
